# Reinforcement Learning on Frozen Lake

 Welcome to our project on Reinforcement Learning of the Frozen Lake Game using Q-Learning and SARSA Algorithms. In this project, we will be exploring the concepts of reinforcement learning and applying them to the popular Frozen Lake game. Our aim is to teach an agent to navigate the frozen lake environment and reach the goal successfully.

 ## What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions, which helps it to learn what actions are good and what actions are bad. Over time, the agent learns to make better decisions that maximize its reward.

## The Frozen Lake Game
The Frozen Lake game is a classic example used to demonstrate RL algorithms. It is a grid-based game in which an agent must navigate from a starting position to a goal position while avoiding holes in the ice. The environment is represented by a grid of tiles, each of which can be either frozen or a hole. The agent can move in four directions - up, down, left, or right - but it will slide until it hits an obstacle.

## Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-Learning is a popular RL algorithm used for finding optimal policies in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment. It works by learning an action-value function, Q(s,a), which estimates the expected return of taking an action a in state s. The agent updates the Q-values after each action based on the reward it receives and the estimated future rewards.

## SARSA Algorithm
SARSA is another popular RL algorithm used for finding optimal policies in MDP environments. It is similar to Q-Learning, but instead of learning the Q-values, it learns the state-action values, Q(s,a). The agent updates the Q-values after each action based on the reward it receives and the estimated future rewards, using the action it takes in the next state.

## How we will implement Q-Learning and SARSA in the Frozen Lake Game
We will be using the OpenAI Gym library to simulate the Frozen Lake environment. We will implement both the Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms and compare their performance in navigating the frozen lake environment. We will start with a simple Q-Table approach and later move on to more advanced algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQNs).

## Conclusion
In this project, we have discussed the concepts of Reinforcement Learning and applied them to the Frozen Lake game using Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms. We have seen how these algorithms learn from rewards to navigate an environment and reach a goal. We hope this project will provide a better understanding of RL algorithms and inspire you to explore more on your own. Thank you for reading!
