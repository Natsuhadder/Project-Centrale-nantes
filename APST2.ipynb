    "## Description of the problem (taken from the website)*\n",
    "The game starts with the player at location [0,0] of the frozen lake grid world with the goal located at far extent of the world e.g. [3,3] for the 4x4 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations when using a pre-determined map or in random locations when a random map is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Space\n",
    "The action shape is (1,) in the range {0, 3} indicating which direction to move the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "0: Move left\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Move down\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Move right\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Move up\n",
    "#### Observation Space\n",
    "The observation is a value representing the playerâ€™s current position as current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15. The number of possible observations is dependent on the size of the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation is returned as an int().\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting State\n",
    "The episode starts with the player in state [0] (location [0, 0]).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rewards\n",
    "Reward schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach goal: +1\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach hole: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach frozen: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Episode End\n",
    "The episode ends if the following happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "Termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The player moves into a hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player reaches the goal at max(nrow) * max(ncol) - 1 (location [max(nrow)-1, max(ncol)-1])."
